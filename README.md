# Dockerized with VSCode Remote Containers

This example shows how to set up _dockerized_ to use the container defined in the `.devcontainer` folder that the VSCode Remote Containers feature uses.

This allows you to have a single definition for a development environment which can be used both by VSCode and _dockerized_ (outside VSCode, for example in a CI server).

To see how to use a Remote Container which is using Docker Compose, see [this example](../vscode-remote-container-docker-compose/).
